## Project 1: **Improving Sperm Whale and Beaked Whale Density Estimation from towed arrays**

### Target Outcome

Expanding regional applications and improving functionality of an existing tool to support density estimation through application of a distance sampling framework.

### Summary

Incorporation of passive acoustic information in stock assessment reports necessitates density estimation. Current methods for density estimation are time consuming or only tested in region- and species-specific datasets. This project will improve functionality of the existing multi-target tracking tool that is used by PIFSC to extract perpendicular distance information from data to support density and abundance estimation. Work will include testing, modifying, and validating the tool on Sperm Whale and Beaked Whale datasets from multiple regions (NEFSC, SEFSC). The outcome of this project would support the PAM SI objective of data integration to support stock assessments by advancing the technology readiness of PAM inclusion in Stock Assessment Reports in multiple NOAA Fisheries regions. 

### Action Items

1.  **Identify challenges:** Yvonne and Jen gather possible array parameters that might break the multi-target tracking tool and meet with Pina to discuss the expected investment required to adapt the tool. *Deadline: April 2024*

2.  **Prepare test datasets:** Gather test datasets from NE/SE/PI. *Deadline: May 2024*

3.  **Training on Multi-target tracking tool:** Yvonne and Pina will train others on executing the tool in MATLAB. *Deadline: August 2024.*

4.  **Test cases:** Basic assessment of the tool on NE and SE datasets to identify bugs *Deadline: December 2024*

5.  **Resolve bugs:** Pina or others address usability needs of all users. *Deadline: July 2025*

6.  **Aspirational step to improve tool:** If time and capacity allows, consider attempting to integrate depth estimation for more accurate horizontal distance estimation for deep divers based on Yvonne/Annamaria's work. *Deadline: July 2026.*

## Project 2: Incorporating glider data in a species distribution modeling framework

### Target Outcome

Advancing the accuracy of stock assessments to capture seasonal and long-term changes using glider PAM datasets.

### Summary

This project would support the PAM SI objective of advancing data integration by leveraging glider-based PAM data and visual data to improve the accuracy of stock assessments by capturing seasonal and long-term changes. This project would focus on developing a statistical framework for integrating a density model created with glider PAM data with existing visual-based SDMs to achieve more accurate models with seasonal context. This project is ideally leveraging OPR Climate IRA funding proposed by Badger & Whitney, if funded. 

### Action Items

1.  **Evaluate state of the science:** Connect with CREEM and other colleagues to assess the state of the science. *Deadline: May 2024*

2.  **Evaluate resources required:** Evaluate required funding depending on other proposals and staffing. *Deadline: May 2024*

3.  **Identify datasets and species:** Collect and collate PI, SE, and SW glider data and identify priority species for modeling based on data availability and management needs (e.g., deep-divers). *Deadline: August 2024*

4.  **Assess analytical next steps:** Establish working group to assess suitable modeling frameworks that fit glider data. February 2025

## Project 3: Incorporating stationary data into a species distribution modeling framework

### Target Outcome

Advancing the accuracy of stock assessments to capture seasonal and long-term changes using long-term PAM datasets.

### Summary

This project would support the PAM SI objective of advancing data integration by leveraging stationary PAM data and visual data to improve the accuracy of stock assessments by capturing seasonal and long-term changes. This project would focus on developing a statistical framework for integrating a density model created with stationary PAM data with existing visual-based SDMs to achieve more accurate models with seasonal context. This project is ideally leveraging LISTEN GoMex funding to develop models for sperm whales and beaked whales. 

### Action Items

1.  **Establish collaboration:** Meet with Lance Garrison to identify his interest and willingness to convene a working group to support his ongoing effort and work towards broader applicability of the outcomes. *Deadline: April 2024*

2.  **Identify resources required:** Evaluate whether LISTEN GoMex requires more resources to make these methods broadly applicable. *Deadline: April 2024*

3.  **Establish project team:** Establish working group to meet periodically with the LISTEN GoMex team to assess viability. *Deadline: May 2024*

4.  **Expand capacity:** Advertise post-doc position to support this effort. *Deadline: June 2024*
