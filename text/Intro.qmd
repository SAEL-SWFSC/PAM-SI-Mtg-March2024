Introduction

NMFS’ Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) programs focus on collecting underwater sound recordings of the marine environment. Identification of the sounds produced by protected marine mammal species, fishes, or humans allows for an understanding of marine soundscapes. PAM data collection provides information on changes in species distribution, behavior and/or density, in addition to assessing impacts of man made noise. The technological revolution in PAM over the past decade has allowed both acoustic recorders and analytical approaches to increasingly become an integral part of NMFS’s core science mission. PAM’s capacity for creating long term time series makes it an ideal approach for evaluating changes in species stocks, ecosystem interactions and climate change. There currently are 7 NMFS PAM programs including each NMFS Science Center and the S&T’s Ocean Acoustic Program. PAM data can be archival (recorder needs to be recovered at sea before data can be accessed) or real time (data is transmitted via cable or satellite as it is collected). Currently, NMFS PAM programs use all available acoustic platforms from stationary bottom mounted to mobile towed, drifting, or UxS platforms. However, each program varies in the level of technological development and operational capacity. Over the next 4 years we aim to work to resolve the core roadblocks that hold back PAM’s ability to be fully operational across NMFS.

The PAM SI projects focus on; 1) establishing a Pacific region glider program to mirror that in the Atlantic, 2) developing National PAM Cloud capabilities to cope with exponential growth in data and processing needs, 3) expand the existing PACM decision support tool to a National level tool, and 4) streamlining analytical and data integration to remove redundancy and increase across FMC efficiencies.

The PAM SI Workshop in March 2024 was a three-day gathering to identify synergies and common challenges across NOAA Fisheries passive acoustics groups and the agency more broadly as well as decide priority projects to accomplish during the Strategic Initiative. This workshop was an opportunity for folks from all NOAA Fisheries Regional Science Centers and our partners in the Office of Science and Technology, Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, and National Centers for Environmental Information to gather together.

The first day of the workshop focused on identifying synergies and getting to know each other and the ongoing passive acoustic research better. Day two was spent in two Round Table Discussion sessions, offering extended periods of time for detailed discussion to identify and define priority projects that address the SI objectives as well as common goals and challenges faced. The workshop culminated with a series of demonstrations of exising PAM tools and a discussion of the target management outcomes and tools of the PAM SI, specifically focused on stock assessments and climate change.
