### Summary

This project will add soundscape metrics for priority SI PAM datasets alongside audio files and other metrics to the NCEI Passive Acoustics archive. The soundscape metrics will be used to develop and demonstrate soundscape interpretation and visualization tools being developed as part of the SI. The datasets will also facilitate comparison of data sampled by multiple recording technologies and projects that are unique to select FMCs. A technical guide for processing and archiving PAM data will also be prepared as part of this project. This project will work with SI cloud computing projects to operationalize soundscape metric processing software in the cloud environment.Â Streamlining and documenting methods to process and archive soundscape metrics supports PAM SI objectives to advance PAM data analysis and integration approaches, and advance archival cloud capabilities.

8.  **Generate Hybrid milli-decade output:** FMCs will conduct HMD processing either locally or through the PAM SI Cloud computing and save to NCEI or internal PAM SI cloud environment. *Deadline: Jan 2025 - March 2025*

9.  **NCEI archive data products:** All HMDs will be processed and sent to NCEI archive for level 2-3 data products. *Deadline: March 2025*

10. **Facilitate more complex soundscape analyses:** All priority soundscape datasets and HMD level 1 products will be cloud archived at NCEI or NODD for use in the Soundscape interpretation and visualization project. *Deadline: March 2025*

11. **Support comparison across platforms:** Comparison of soundscape metric results from simultaneously deployed platforms; develop tools to support this type of comparison (ie. PAMscapes). The data processing groups will establish methods for comparison, ongoing opportunistic evaluation will occur throughout the SI, and results will be added to the GitHub Soundscape Group and reported with example datasets. *Deadline: Dependent on participation*

| Jason Gedamke/Samara Haver | Haruphone  | SoundTrap  |

12. **Support comparison across datasets with known differences:** Develop a format or tool to support comparison of datasets with known differences, such as perfect timing (MARS), dropped time (SoundTrap), duty cycled (AK, NW), frequency-dependent calibration (NRS, HARP), file format (XWAV). *Deadline: Dependent on participation*

## Project 2: Soundscape metric interpretation and visualization

### Target Outcome

Create a set of soundscape metric interpretation open-source processing pathways and visualizations for cross-FMCs comparisons and FMCs-specific soundscape priorities.

### Summary

This project will build on existing tools in PAMscapes (R/CRAN) to create and document processing pathways for soundscape metric interpretation. NOAA Noise Reference Station soundscape metrics will be used to build the pathways and evaluate outputs. Additional soundscape metrics from SI priority data sets will be incorporated based on availability from priority project #1 for soundscapes. This priority supports SI objective #2 by creating decision-support tools that are relevant at regional and national scales. It also supports #4 by integrating PAM data with variables to provide context for different soundscapes (environmental data, species-detections, etc).

### Action Items

1.  **Establish working group:** Establish working group and create folder in shared Google doc folder. *Deadline: March 2024*

2.  **Identify datasets:** Decide on priority Noise Reference Stations (NRS) datasets for metric development. *Deadline: April 2024*

3.  **Data products to NCEI:** NRS Hybrid Milli-Decade (HMD) products to be included in initial comparison sent to NCEI. *Deadline: May 2024*

4.  **Identify visualization options:** Organize and expand on options for HMD data visualizations as originally prepared for PAMscapes, share with working group via Google doc folder for discussion of level 1 visualization goals. Ideas and inspiration will be organized for project team brainstorm and feedback meeting*. Deadline: July 2024*

5.  **Develop workplan:** Set-up work plan with Taiki Sakai to evaluate HMD QA/QC with visualizations in PAMscapes including level 1 visualizations such as percentiles, LTSA, and bringing together MANTA and pyPAM default output. *Deadline: June 2024*

7.  **Level 2 data product planning:** In coordination with QA/QC tool development, and informed by ongoing collaboration with SoundCoop partners, the Soundscape group will develop level 2 visualization for HMD output by: integrating environmental data (currents, wind, ice, etc) and time/frequency bins for quantitative visualization (e.g., SPD). The option to integrate these visualization as additional PAMscapes functionality or publish as separate code on GitHub will be evaluated. *Deadline: March 2025 (discuss and gather feedback at 2025 SI Workshop)*
