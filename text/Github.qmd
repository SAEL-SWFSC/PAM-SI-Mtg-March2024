### Project Team

| Becca Van Hoeck (NEFSC) | Sofie Van Parijs (NEFSC) | PAM SI Working Group |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|

### Summary

The PAM SI consists of multiple objectives and priority projects with various subsets of the full PAM SI working group. Coordination of the PAM SI through GitHub will serve to create an easy to access record of PAM SI meetings, provide project management support, and facilitate learning of how to collaborate through GitHub. 

### Action Items

1.  **Workshop Report:** Generate and finalize the March 2024 PAM SI Workshop Report. *Deadline: April 2024*

2.  **Identify Coordination Needs:** Define high priority coordination needs and workflows based on workshop discussion. *Deadline: April 2024.*

3.  **Coordinate with UxS SI:** Check in on Pacific Glider objectives and develop a PAM Glider Repository to be shared with the PAM SI. *Deadline: June 2024 (start)*

4.  **Ongoing Coordination:** Continue coordination of the PAM SI priority objectives through GitHub Issues, Project cards, and Discussions. *Deadline: ongoing throughout SI.*

## Project 2: Create National PAM Sharing Structure

### Target Outcome

Enhance National PAM collaboration among the NOAA Fisheries Science Centers through a common GitHub structure. 

### Project Team

| Becca Van Hoeck (NEFSC)            | Sofie Van Parijs (NEFSC) | Kourtney Burger (SWFSC) |
|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Science center representatives TBD |                          |                         |

### Summary

A priority objective of the IRA PAM Strategic Initiative is to streamline processes to remove redundancy and increase cross-FMC efficiencies. To achieve this objective, a framework for improved information sharing across the FMC’s is required. This project will create a standardized method of information sharing across the NOAA Fisheries science center PAM teams through GitHub. By collectively hosting information on GitHub we will create a foundation and culture for sharing that will build in complexity over time to include specific analysis protocols, data outputs, and other necessary tools. 

### Action Items

1.  **GitHub training:** Kourtney will train Becca on how to create a GitHub lab manual. *Deadline: March 2024*

2.  **Develop and demonstrate National PAM Sharing Structure:** Develop and demonstrate the National and Regional PAM Sharing structures with SWFSC and NEFSC use case examples. *Deadline: May 2024.*

3.  **Establish NMFS PAM Team:** Establish NOAA Fisheries PAM GitHub Team on the Office of Science and Technology GitHub Organization. *Deadline: June 2024*

4.  **Publish National PAM Github Lab Manual:** Publish a National PAM GitHub Lab Manual on GitHub. *Deadline: July 2024*

5.  **Create Regional PAM Lab Manuals:** Support each science center in creating a lab manual that aligns with the National sharing structure. *Deadline: July 2025*

6.  **Expand information sharing:** Add the lists created by the Acoustic Detection Software team to the National PAM GitHub. *Deadline: July 2025*

7.  **Convene GitHub working group:** Convene a working group of PAM SI members to continue discussing how to advance PAM sharing for analysis, QA/QC methods, and protocols, etc. *Deadline: July 2025*

## Project 3: Participate in OpenScapes

### Target Outcome

Facilitate learning and effective collaboration while creating the NMFS PAM Sharing structure.

### Project Team

| Becca Van Hoeck (NEFSC)            | Shannon Rankin (SWFSC) |     |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|-----|
| Science center representatives TBD |                        |     |

### Summary

OpenScapes is an open science initiative to support more efficient collaboration and better science. Through a cohort based short-term sprint, participants are provided resources and training to support open science collaboration.  One representative from each science center will participate in a PAM SI Openscapes cohort to develop the NMFS PAM Sharing structure (see previous project) in real-time, while bringing the lessons learned back to their broader science center PAM group. Participation in OpenScapes would build foundational knowledge and practical experience collaborating to support successful implementation of all PAM SI objectives and priority projects.   

### Action Items

1.  **Confirm OpenScapes cohort:** Identify potential OpenScapes Champions workshops that can accommodate the NMFS PAM SI cohort. *Deadline: June 2024*

2.  **Sign-up for OpenScapes:** Pending confirmation of the OpenScapes cohort, Shannon will confirm that the PAM team is registered for the cohort. *Deadline: June 2024.*

3.  **Identify cohort:** Each science center will recommend at least one participant for the OpenScapes cohort who can dedicate at least 3 hours a week to the collaboration. *Deadline: June 2024*

4.  **Identify cohort priority:** The PAM team will convene a meeting prior to the start of the OpenScapes cohort to discuss and agree on project priorities from the list provided during the PAM SI Workshop. *Deadline: June 2024*

5.  **Participate in OpenScapes:** OpenScapes is a 6-week sprint scheduled to begin in Spring/Summer 2024 *Deadline: TBD*

6.  **Report back to Science Centers:** Following conclusion of the cohort we will facilitate knowledge sharing between the science center representatives and the broader regional PAM teams. *Deadline: within 2 months from the end of the OpenScapes workshop.*
