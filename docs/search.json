He started at MML as a postdoc in 2010 to apply acoustics to Cook Inlet Beluga (CIB) to expand knowledge on seasonal distribution and effects of noise, but soon got involved in other PAM projects for MML, often in collaboration with Catherine Berchok’s group. He continues do do beluga PAM in Cook Inlet and other regions of AK, but is also involved in work on other species in topics including hearing, behavioral response, noise mitigation, noise regulation, and soundscape characterization.\n\n\n1.2.5 \n\n\n1.2.6 Cory Hom-Weaver, SWFSC\nCory started working as an acoustic ecologist at SWFSC in 2020. During her time at the center, her research has focused the detection and classification of baleen whales in the California Current Ecosystem.

Megan helps to unravel these complex data by applying analytical tools- both new and existing- into standardized data processing pathways. While interested in metrics that look at the whole soundscape, vessel noise is often a focus. Megan also teaches graduate classes on marine science and policy at Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey. When not working, Megan is out exploring the beautiful central coast of California with her family.\n\n\n1.2.11 \n\n\n1.2.12 Shannon Rankin, SWFSC\nShannon leads the Southwest Acoustic Ecology Lab at SWFSC in La Jolla.

She has a passion for beaked whales, and loves to go out in the field to catch a glimpse (acoustically or visually) of them. Unsurprisingly, a very influential paper to her career was Peter Tyack’s Extreme diving of beaked whales, as it provided one of the first looks into this elusive genus of whales. She has two young children that keep her busy outside of work.\n\n\n\n1.2.15 Samara Haver, CIMERS\nSamara is a research associate in the Oregon State University/NOAA PMEL Cooperative Institute for Marine Ecosystems and Resources Studies.
